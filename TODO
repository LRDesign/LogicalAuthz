GroupUsersController => GroupMembersController

Group::members alias for the member class?  (::users etc)


Groups -> Roles

Roles with scopes


"criteria" is a terrible name - it describes something that isn't a criteria.

What I need is a name for "the traits of an access request that will be
evaluated to determine if the request conforms to policy" - that found, I need to rename "criteria" everywhere to... whatever it is.


Authorized Menu: render in a block - if any authorization decision is 
"allow", render the captured block, otherwise discard.
